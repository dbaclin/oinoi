            <h3>Simpler than Excel!</h3>
            <p>
              I have been struggling to get insights from my internal ordering system. With oinoi, I can get the information I want about my sales in about 3 minutes when I needed 1 hour of hard work to clean my data in Excel before (and I had to take an Excel class before being able to do the same things)

            <p>
              I have been convincing my my staff to use Oinoi because I think you have made this as sleek as any visual tool I have encountered. Indeed there's not too much clutter or bells and whistles, and with the bonus of coding skills being unneeded.

              As data consultant, Oinoi enables me to quickly show results to a client even during the very first meeting. When other tools require days before showing the first piece of insights, Oinoi helps me deliver results faster.

              Oinoi helps you in real time every step of the analytical process by suggesting you different actions, whether it's to prepare data for analysis or creating visualizations.
              It's a bit like having a data scientist by your side.

              Oinoi allows you to replay previous transformations on a new set of data so that you can focus on finding answers from your data and not spend time re-doing the same tedious tasks over and over again.
            </p><!-- 
            <p>
              Looking at all the transformations steps is also a great way for your colleagues to understand how you have been treating the data which is a great way to spread the knowledge.

              We also offer oinoi on premise if you cannot upload your data over the internet for legal or policy reasons, in which case your data never leaves your company's network.

            These tools do not allow the users to perform complex transformations such as data reshaping in an intuitive way. They also work well for power users but new users tend to be quickly limited in the number of operations they can perform.

            These tools also don't offer interactive visulizations, an automated history of all the transformations that have been applied on the data or more advanced analytical methods.
