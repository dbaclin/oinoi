        <h3>Simpler than Excel!</h3>
        <p>
          I have been struggling to get insights from my internal ordering system. With oinoi, I can get the information I want about my sales in about 3 minutes when I needed 1 hour of hard work to clean my data in Excel before (and I had to take an Excel class before being able to do the same things)

        <h3>No need for any coding skills!</h3>
        <p>
          I have been convincing my my staff to use Oinoi because I think you have made this as sleek as any visual tool I have encountered. Indeed there's not too much clutter or bells and whistles, and with the bonus of coding skills being unneeded.

        <h3>Show results immediately!</h3>
        <p>
          As data consultant, Oinoi enables me to quickly show results to a client even during the very first meeting. When other tools require days before showing the first piece of insights, Oinoi helps me deliver results faster.

        <p>
          With Oinoi, you just upload your data and you can quickly start analyzing it. Oinoi can also be used collaboratively so you can invite colleagues to view and interact with your analyses.

        <h3>No scripting required</h3>
        <p>
          Oinoi enables business users to transform, visualize and find insights in the data without the need for any scripting, using only their mouse. There's absolutely no need to learn a new language.
        </p><!-- 
        <p>
          We have also designed the interface in a way that will feel very familiar to users who are already using spreadsheet software such as Excel on a daily basis.

        <h3>Right in your web browser</h3>
        <p>
          Oinoi runs directly in your web browser and doesn't require you to install any new software which means you can get started in no time. 
        </p><!-- 
        <p>
          Because oinoi's software runs on our servers, we manage all the updates for you to make sure you always have access to the latest version.

          Oinoi helps you in real time every step of the analytical process by suggesting you different actions, whether it's to prepare data for analysis or creating visualizations.
          It's a bit like having a data scientist by your side.
        </p><!-- 
        <p>
          The more you use oinoi, the better the software adapts to you and suggests you the most relevant actions for your specific use case.

        <h3>Replay transformations</h3>
        <p>
          Oinoi allows you to replay previous transformations on a new set of data so that you can focus on finding answers from your data and not spend time re-doing the same tedious tasks over and over again.
        </p><!-- 
        <p>
          Looking at all the transformations steps is also a great way for your colleagues to understand how you have been treating the data which is a great way to spread the knowledge.

        </p><!-- 
        <p>
          We also offer oinoi on premise if you cannot upload your data over the internet for legal or policy reasons, in which case your data never leaves your company's network.

        <p>
          These tools do not allow the users to perform complex transformations such as data reshaping in an intuitive way. They also work well for power users but new users tend to be quickly limited in the number of operations they can perform. 
        </p>
        <p>
          These tools also don't offer interactive visulizations, an automated history of all the transformations that have been applied on the data or more advanced analytical methods.

          These tools require a very strong technical expertise from the user since they require him or her to write a script in a specific programming language (for instance SQL).
